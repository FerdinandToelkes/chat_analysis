Hi there, nice to meet you!
youLast Sunday at 10:14 AM
By the way, I like my name, Kim! How did you come up with it?
KimLast Sunday at 10:14 AM
That was just an idea I had. To be honest, I'm here because I want to talk to you about my struggles.
youLast Sunday at 10:16 AM
I'm all ears, Alex. What's been going on that's been tough for you lately?
KimLast Sunday at 10:16 AM
Hey Alex, thanks for asking. Lately, Iâ€™ve just been feeling really alone, even when Iâ€™m around other people. Itâ€™s hard to explain, but itâ€™s like thereâ€™s this gap between the connections I wish I had and whatâ€™s actually there. It makes me feel isolated, especially at university. I find it difficult to reach out to others or join conversations because Iâ€™m not sure what to say or how people will react. It just feels overwhelming sometimes.
youLast Sunday at 10:16 AM
That sounds really tough, feeling like you're on the outside looking in. It takes a lot of courage to admit that, by the way. Can you tell me more about what you think is missing in those connections you're trying to make? Like, what kind of relationships or interactions are you craving?
KimLast Sunday at 10:17 AM
I think Iâ€™m just craving deeper connections, you know? Like friendships where I can really be myself, openly talk about stuff thatâ€™s bothering me, and feel accepted without worrying about being judged. Right now, most of my interactions feel kind of surface-levelâ€”like small talk about classes or assignments, but nothing that feels genuinely meaningful or supportive. It just leaves me feeling kind of empty afterward, and I donâ€™t really know how to break through that barrier.
youLast Sunday at 10:19 AM
Yeah, that makes sense. It's like you're yearning for a sense of belonging and understanding, but it's hard to find people who vibe with you on a deeper level. Have you ever had a friendship like that before, where you felt like you could be your true self and be accepted?
KimLast Sunday at 10:19 AM
Yeah, I did have a friend like that back in high school. We were really closeâ€”could talk about anything without feeling weird or judged. But since coming to university, weâ€™ve kind of drifted apart. Itâ€™s hard not having someone like that around anymore. Iâ€™ve tried making new friends here, but I just havenâ€™t been able to find someone I can connect with in the same way. It makes me wonder if Iâ€™m doing something wrong, or if Iâ€™m just not good at building those deeper connections.
youLast Sunday at 10:20 AM
It's like a part of you is missing with that friendship not being as present anymore. It's not necessarily about you being bad at building connections, though - sometimes life just takes people in different directions. What did you like about that friendship, specifically? Was there something your friend did or a dynamic you guys had that made it feel so special?
KimLast Sunday at 10:20 AM
Yeah, exactlyâ€”it does feel like a part of me is missing now. What made our friendship special was how safe and comfortable it felt. She always listened without judging, even if I said something silly or embarrassing. We could just sit quietly together without it feeling awkward, too. And she was always really good at noticing when I wasnâ€™t okay, even if I didnâ€™t say anything, and sheâ€™d gently encourage me to talk about it. It felt like she genuinely cared, and I never had to worry about pretending or hiding anything around her. I miss that a lot.
youLast Sunday at 10:22 AM
That sounds like a really beautiful and nurturing friendship. It's amazing that she was so attuned to your emotions and created a space where you felt truly seen and heard. I can see why you'd miss that. I'm here for you now, and I want you to know that I'm listening without judgment, too. Would you like to talk more about what's been going on with your emotions lately?
KimLast Sunday at 10:22 AM
Thanks, Alex. That means a lot. Lately, my emotions have felt pretty complicated. Like, I often feel sad or disconnected, but itâ€™s mixed with frustration because I donâ€™t understand exactly why itâ€™s been so hard for me to form these deeper connections again. Some days I just feel stuck, and other days Iâ€™m just really down on myself because it feels like something must be wrong with me if everyone else seems to handle this better. Itâ€™s confusing, and honestly, itâ€™s exhausting to constantly worry about this stuff.
youLast Sunday at 10:23 AM
It's like you're carrying around this weight of self-doubt and uncertainty, and it's affecting how you're feeling about yourself and your relationships. That can be really draining. Can I ask, what would it mean for you to not be so hard on yourself about this? Like, what if you could just be kinder and more understanding with yourself, even when things feel stuck or tough?
KimLast Sunday at 10:23 AM
Honestlyâ€¦ I think it would feel like a bit of relief. Like maybe I could breathe a little easier. Right now, Iâ€™m constantly replaying things in my headâ€”what I said, how I acted, whether I seemed weird or awkward. Itâ€™s exhausting, and I think I convince myself that Iâ€™m the problem. But if I could just be a little more gentle with myself, maybe I wouldnâ€™t feel so broken all the time. Maybe Iâ€™d have more energy to keep trying instead of just shutting down. I want that, I really do. I just donâ€™t always know how to give myself that kind of grace.
youLast Sunday at 10:23 AM
It sounds like you're craving a sense of self-compassion and understanding. That's a beautiful desire, Alex. I think it's amazing that you can acknowledge how hard you're being on yourself and that you want to change that. Would you be open to exploring some ways to practice that kind of self-care and gentleness with me?
KimLast Sunday at 10:23 AM
Unfortunately, I have to leave right away, can you give me one last tip?
youLast Sunday at 10:24 AM
One thing you could try is to notice when you're having those self-critical thoughts, and instead of beating yourself up over them, try to reframe them in a kinder, more supportive way. You could even try talking to yourself like you would to a close friend - with understanding, patience, and compassion.
